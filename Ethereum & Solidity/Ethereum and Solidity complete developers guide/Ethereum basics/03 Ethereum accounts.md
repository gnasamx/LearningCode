### :key: Ethereum accounts

When Metamask created account for us, it created account that has three distinct
pieces of information, A Account address, Public key and Private key. These are
the three pieces of information that constitutes in account Ethereum network.

- Account address: It is a unique identifier that can be shared with any one in
  the world, that tells who you are.

- Public key and Private Key: This two piece of information combine together to
  essentially form a password of source. Public key and Private key are use to
  authorize the sending of funds from your account to other accounts. The
  account address, public key and private are all store in hexadecimal numbers.

The Ethereum accounts:

- Main

- Ropsten

- Kovan

- Rinkeby

One interesting behavior about Ethereum account:

In case of Email accounts, test@gmail.com and test@yahoo.com are two distinctly
separate accounts in real world. but in Ethereum world account is use across all
different networks that we ever interact with it.
